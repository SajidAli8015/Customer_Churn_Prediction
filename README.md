# 📞 Churn Prediction for Telecom Customers

This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a telecom company using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build an end-to-end churn prediction system that can identify customers likely to churn and help businesses take proactive retention actions.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Build a robust churn prediction model using real customer data
- Improve recall to correctly identify as many churners as possible
- Perform advanced feature engineering and model explainability (SHAP)
- Compare multiple models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and LightGBM
- Select the best model and deploy it as an API with a user interface (Flask)
- Package the app using Docker for portable deployment

---

## 📊 Key Highlights

- 📂 Realistic customer data with over 30+ features
- 🧠 Advanced Feature Engineering & Encoding
- ⚖️ Addressed class imbalance using SMOTE and `scale_pos_weight`
- ✅ Model Evaluation with Precision, Recall, AUC, and F1 Score
- 🎯 Threshold optimization to improve recall without hurting precision
- 🌐 Model Deployment using Flask API + Streamlit UI + Docker container

---

## 🔍 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains customer-level information such as:

- **Demographics** (Gender, Senior Citizen, Partner, etc.)
- **Services** (Internet, Streaming, Device Protection, etc.)
- **Account Info** (Tenure, MonthlyCharges, Contract Type)
- **Target Variable**: `Churn` (Yes/No)

## 🔧 Feature Engineering

Several new features were created:

- `is_long_term_contract`
- `has_bundle`
- `is_senior_alone`
- `low_tenure_high_charge`
- `is_tech_dependent`
- `total_services`: based on cleaned service columns

Also, `TotalCharges` was converted from object to numeric and cleaned.

---

## 🧪 Feature Selection

- For **Logistic Regression**: Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross Validation (RFECV)
- For **Random Forest** & **LightGBM**: SHAP values used to select top features
- Highly correlated features were removed based on SHAP importance

---

## ⚙️ Model Building Workflow

1. **Baseline Model**: Logistic Regression
2. **Model 2**: Random Forest (SHAP + grid search)
3. **Model 3**: LightGBM (SHAP + grid search)

All models evaluated using F1, Recall, Precision, AUC.

---

## 📈 Model Evaluation Summary

| Model                | Precision | Recall | F1 Score | AUC     |
|---------------------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| Logistic Regression | 0.61      | 0.65   | 0.63     | 0.83    |
| Random Forest        | 0.49      | 0.83   | 0.62     | 0.83    |
| **LightGBM**      | **0.59**  | **0.81** | **0.69** | **0.83** |

> **Final Model Selected: LightGBM** - Best balance between recall and precision
